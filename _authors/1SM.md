Hello folks! I am Stefano Mandelli, PhD student at the University of Milan. My main field is the ***Instrumentation Cosmology***. This branch of the physics is devoted in the feasability study, performance forecast, manufacture and deploy of telescope for observing the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. In this context, we are involved in the measurement of a specific correlation pattern of the polarization direction of the CMB's photons. This very particular correlation between the polarization angles of the photons (linearly polarized by the Thomson scattering at the last surface of scattering) is called B-modes, because this pattern remotely remember the disposition of the vectors direction of the electromagnetic B fields that is characterized by \\( \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} =0 \\).

In the `cmbgroundbased` organization and accordingly with the main topic of my research field, I am involved in the development and maintainace of the CAL (CMB Atmospheric Library) for assessing the spurious contribute of the atmosphere on the ground-based measurements. Morover, I am also involved in the development of a new mapmaker algirithm specific for the ground-based TOD produced by the telescope.
