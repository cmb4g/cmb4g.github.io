This company is born with a very challenging target: to be the central point for the scientist involved in the CMB Ground-Based observation. Is well known that the CMB ground-based missions have to deal with a very hard-model, and moving (by the wind shears) foreground, represented by the atmosphere. The water-vapor and Oxygen emission lines represent an extra optical load that shines our sensors with the consequence of loss in sensitivity.
