Test

- The project was developed by X and Y
- The main topic: create precise assessment and forecast of the atmospheric noise contribute in the white and correlated noise
- We created a GitHub Organization with the whole code suite in order to: create the statistical atmospheric picture of the site, create simulation of the telescope observations and finally analyze the generated samples with a Monte Carlo approach.

- The simulation code was written in C++ but python bindings are available. In the next future will be covered also the support for `Julia >= 1.0`
